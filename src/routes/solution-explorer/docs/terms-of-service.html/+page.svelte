those exclusions and limitations and states that it prevails over them.<br/>
<b>Goods<br/></b>5. The description of the Goods is as set out in the customer quotation ref: QU-0[number]<br/>6. In the case of Goods made to the Customer's special requirements, it is the Customer's <br/>
responsibility to ensure that any information provided by it is accurate.<br/>
<b>Basis of Sale<br/></b>7. No variation of the Contract, whether about description of the Goods, price or otherwise, can be <br/>
made after it has been entered into unless the variation is agreed by the Customer and the <br/>

<hr/>

<b>Price and Payment<br/></b>8. The price of the Goods is that set out in the accepted quotation ref:  QU-0[number] or such other<br/>

may have, the Supplier shall be entitled to suspend production and/or deliveries of Goods and/or <br/>
performance of Services until paid.<br/>

allowed installation date. <br/>

entitled to rescind the Contract in respect of those Goods and return them, and the liability of the<br/>

period, agreed in the Contract, or failing any agreement, without undue delay.<br/>

Goods at the Delivery Location, the Supplier can charge the reasonable costs of storing and<br/>

than 1 Working Day after the agreed date for delivery.<br/>
17.The Customer must inspect the Goods immediately on delivery and must no later than 7 Working <br/>
Days after delivery notify the Supplier in writing of any shortage in delivery, damage or any other <br/>
non-conformity with the Contract that ought reasonably to have been apparent on a reasonable <br/>
inspection of the Goods.<br/>
<b>Risk and Title<br/></b>18.Risk of loss of or damage to the Goods shall pass to the Customer at the time of delivery of the <br/>
Goods.<br/>
19.The Supplier will still own the Goods, regardless of delivery, until the Customer has paid the <br/>
Supplier in full for those Goods and VAT thereon, and all other sums due from the Customer to the <br/>
Supplier at that time, provided that the property in the Goods can pass from the Supplier upon <br/>
such property passing to the Customer's buyer in the manner  permitted below.<br/>
<b>Warranty<br/></b>20.Premium Lithium accepts liability for all Solar Panels, Home Batteries, Inverters, and EV Chargers <br/>
supplied and installed by them. The total warranty period for each (except EV chargers) is 10 <br/>
years. After the 10-year period, Premium Lithium will no longer be liable for the maintenance of <br/>
the system, even though some components (such as the Solar Panels) may still be warrantied by <br/>
the manufacturer.<br/>
21.EV car chargers are not covered under the 10-year warranty, but are instead covered by the <br/>

for the relevant item. If the Supplier complies with this obligation it shall have no further liability in<br/>
respect of, or arising  from the relevant Goods.<br/>
<hr/>

24.Where the Customer enters into the Contract as a Consumer, the Customer's statutory <br/>
rights are not reduced or affected by this Agreement.<br/>
25.The Supplier shall not be in breach and the Supplier shall have no obligation if the claim results <br/>
from:<br/>
a. fair wear and tear or damage caused by the Customer's or any third party's default, <br/>
negligence or misuse of the Goods, including accidental or deliberate destruction of or <br/>
damage to the Goods;<br/>
b. any alterations or modifications or repairs to the Goods other than those carried out by the <br/>
Supplier, or third parties nominated or approved in writing by the Supplier (such approval <br/>
not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).<br/>
26.The warranty in this clause does not extend to:<br/>
a. damage to or any need to replace consumables<br/>
<b>Circumstances beyond reasonable control<br/></b>27.In the event of any failure by the Supplier because of something beyond its reasonable control, <br/>

delays by the Supplier's suppliers:<br/>

it will act reasonably, and it will not be liable for any failure which it could not reasonably <br/>
avoid.<br/>

a. a claim, or series of claims arising out of the same circumstances, arising out of the <br/>

(exclusive of VAT and other taxes and duties) by the Customer for the Goods under the <br/>
Contract giving rise to the claims.<br/>
29.Despite any other provision of the Contract, but subject to the first clause under Excluding <br/>
liability, the Supplier shall have no liability however arising out of or in connection with the <br/>
Contract and/or the supply of the Goods for any:<br/>
a. direct or indirect loss of or damage to but not limited to: profit, revenue, business, <br/>
anticipated or expected savings, energy generation, data, goodwill or use.<br/>
b. indirect or consequential loss or damage;<br/>
except to the extent (subject to the Supplier's public and product liability cap in the first sub-<br/>
clause under Excluding liability) that such loss or damage is a consequence of the Supplier's <br/>
negligently causing damage or loss to physical property of the Customer other than the Goods and<br/>
is recovered by the Supplier under its then subsisting insurance.<br/>
30.The Supplier shall not be liable to the Customer for any claim unless made with reasonable details <br/>
in writing to the Supplier without unreasonable delay and in any event no later than (i) 3 months, <br/>
or such longer period as may be reasonable in the circumstances, after the date the claimable <br/>
event first came (or ought reasonably to have come) to the Customer's notice, and (ii) no later <br/>
than 12 months after the delivery of the relevant Goods.<br/>
31.The term &#34;however arising&#34; when used or referred to in this clause covers all causes and actions <br/>
giving rise to the liability of the Supplier arising out of or in connection with the Contract and/or <br/>
the Goods including whether arising by reason of any (i) misrepresentation, negligence, breach of <br/>
statutory duty, other tort, repudiation, renunciation or other breach of contract, restitution or <br/>
otherwise; or (ii) total or partial failure or delay in supply or defective Goods.<br/>
32.The exclusions and limitations of liability contained in this Agreement and in the Contract shall <br/>
apply regardless of whether the loss or damage was foreseeable or whether the Customer notifies<br/>

permitted by law and, in particular, nothing in this Agreement shall affect liability for death or <br/>
personal injury caused by negligence or for fraudulent misrepresentation or other fraud.<br/>
