The price is not just for the battery but for a complete turnkey solution that includes everything you need to manage and reduce your energy costs. This solution includes full case management and application to the National Grid, your chosen Premium Lithium Smart Home Battery, a grade-A inverter, all wiring and mounting equipment, free delivery and installation by our team of experts as well as onboarding and off-site management. All hardware also comes with 10 years’ warranty for full peace of mind. 

Prices on our website are all ex-VAT as many of our customers are able to claim the VAT back. While the current VAT rate for Smart Home Batteries is the standard 20%, if they are combined with renewable energy generation systems such as wind turbines or solar panels, then the VAT rate is reduced to 0%. 

Premium Lithium offer generous discounts of up to 55% based on when you would like your Smart Home Battery installed / delivered. By pre-ordering, we are able to benefit from economies of scaling in production and labour which means we can pass on these savings to customers. 

Whilst many customers may already have solar panels, significant savings can be made with just a Smart Home Battery on its own. If you are considering solar panels for your home, then a Premium Lithium Smart Home Battery solution will allow you to store any excess solar energy for use after the sun sets. 

All Smart Home Battery solutions that are purchased include free delivery and installation. 

All our hardware and equipment come with a fully comprehensive 10-year warranty for your complete peace of mind. 

If you are looking to move house, many customers decide to sell the battery as part of the property. However, if you would like to take the smart battery with you, then for a nominal fee, we can send our team to uninstall the battery and assist in moving it to your new home. 

For our manufacturing, we maintain an exclusive partnership with Delong Energy Company. They might not be widely recognised online, but their reputation in quality production is unparalleled. 

The battery’s lifespan extends up to 37 years when cycled roughly 162 times per year (approximately every other day). This is a more realistic usage pattern than fully charging and discharging daily. Under ideal conditions, this battery promises long-term reliability and efficiency. 

The pre-ordering model has proved to be an effective approach for both Premium Lithium and our customers. Its success is evident from our customer feedback on Trustpilot which you can see here https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/premiumlithium.com. By pooling payments from multiple pre-orders, we are able to place larger orders with our manufacturing partners. This strategy leads to significant savings on purchasing, shipping, and installation planning. 

The payment for pre-orders is not insurance-backed. While insurance-backed payments offer certain security, they introduce additional complexities and costs. These costs would inevitably have to be passed onto our customers, which would offset the benefits of our pre-order savings. For additional security, we provide a complimentary credit card payment service. Utilising this service, you can avail full Section 75 payment protection up to £30,000 through your credit card company. It's an effective way to offer our customers peace of mind without the complexities and costs associated with insurance-backed solutions.
